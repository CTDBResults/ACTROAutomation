 Scenario Outline: DTSP-460: s an organisation I want user inputs to be restricted & validated during Tax Agent's portal registration so that human error can be minimised
    Given I want to login to portal "<PortalName>"
    Then I click on "Create Account"
    Then I check I am on "Registration" page
    Then I see checkbox "RegistrationAsBusiness" as selected
    Then I see checkbox "RegistrationAsTaxAgent" as not selected
    Then I click on "Register as a Tax Agent"
    #Scenario 1: User tries to enter incorrect input type into a restricted fields (e.g. entering ABC into a number field)
    Then I enter the details as
      | Fields                   | Value |
      | InputTaxAgentRegId       | TEST  |
      | InputTaxAgentABN         | TEST  |
      | BusinessAddress_Postcode | TEST  |
    Then I check "InputTaxAgentRegId" is empty
    Then I check "InputTaxAgentABN" is empty
    Then I check "BusinessAddress_Postcode" is empty
    #Scenario 2: Tax Agent Registration details do not pass the frontend validation
    Then I enter the details as
      | Fields                    | Value            |
      | InputTaxAgentABN          |               11 |
      | InputTaxAgentBusinessName | Automated Tester |
    Then I click on button "TermsandConditionsCheckBox2"
    Then I click on button "RegistrationSubmit"
    Then I wait for "1000" millisecond
    Then I see text "Invalid ABN. ABN Should be 11 Digits. Please try again." displayed
